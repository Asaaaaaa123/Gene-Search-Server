const GLOSSARY = [
  ['Bin', 'Visium HD captures expression on a continuous grid of 2 × 2 µm squares; Space Ranger sums them into square bins of 8 and 16 µm (square_008um/, square_016um/). A bin is the unit of the analysis — a small patch of tissue that usually holds parts of several cells, not a cell.'],
  ['UMI', 'Unique molecular identifier: every captured transcript is counted once, so the UMIs of a bin are the transcripts detected in it, its capture depth. A gene is detected in a bin when it has at least one UMI there.'],
  ['Quality control', 'A bin enters the analysis when it detects more than qc.min_genes genes, has more than qc.min_counts UMIs and has less than qc.max_pct_mt percent of its UMIs on mitochondrial genes (names starting with mt-). The Explore tab shows how many bins pass with the current thresholds before anything runs.'],
  ['Region of interest', 'The bins the section-level numbers are computed on. Its transcriptional part drops bins scoring above the 90th percentile for skeletal muscle, nerve or smooth muscle (tissue around the bone); a region drawn on the H&E image can be intersected with it. Positivity rates, fold changes and distances are computed inside it.'],
  ['Depth matching', 'Sections differ in capture depth (UMIs per bin), and a deeper section detects more of every signature. Depth matching downsamples the raw counts of every bin above the median UMIs per bin of the shallowest section to that median (in every section; bins below it are kept), several times, and reports the mean (± SD) over these replicates, so rates are compared at equal depth.'],
  ['Null threshold', 'For each signature, random gene sets of the same size are scored the same way on a sample of bins. The 95th percentile of those null scores is the threshold: a bin above it scores higher than 95% of random gene sets would.'],
  ['Positivity call', 'A bin is positive for a signature when its score exceeds the null threshold, at least two of the signature’s core genes are detected in it, and no competing signature scores higher. Rates are reported with Wilson 95% confidence intervals.'],
  ['Core genes', 'The lineage-restricted genes of a signature (Table 1). Requiring at least two of them to be detected (the two-gene rule) keeps a single shared or ambient transcript from producing a positive call.'],
  ['Competing signature', 'A signature that shares transcripts with another, for example the erythroid and granulocyte signatures for osteoclasts. A bin where a competitor scores higher is not called positive.'],
  ['Tissue assignment', 'Figure 3: the counts of each bin are pooled with its 8 nearest neighbors and every program signature is scored; the bin takes the highest-scoring signature that clears its null threshold with at least two core genes detected, otherwise it stays unassigned (“ambiguous”). Its tissue class is that signature’s class. Deterministic: no graph, seed or resolution parameter.'],
  ['Observed/null distance ratio', 'Figure 4i: the mean distance from each osteoblast-positive bin to the nearest osteoclast-positive bin inside the region of interest, divided by the same mean when the same numbers of positive bins are placed at random in that region. Below 1 the partners are closer than chance, above 1 farther; sections are compared by the ratio of these ratios, because raw distances depend on how many positive bins there are.'],
  ['Leiden domain', 'An unsupervised cluster of bins: Leiden community detection on a nearest-neighbor graph of the principal components (Harmony-integrated across sections). Domains summarize the tissue (Supplementary Figure S5); scores, calls and tests do not depend on them.'],
  ['Unresolved domain', 'A Leiden domain whose top markers are mostly transcripts abundant in every cell (Actb, Tmsb4x, Eef1a1, …) has no interpretable identity; such domains are merged into “unresolved”. Domains of fewer than 100 bins become “unassigned”. The label is defined without reference to the tumor, but it is not tumor-free: the mouse probes of conserved genes also capture the human A549 tumor RNA (Krt7, Krt18), and Tmsb10 and Itm2b track the lesion, so in the tumor-bearing section the unresolved domain is strongly enriched for it. Its share differs between sections (FigureS5_unresolved_bins.csv gives it per section).'],
