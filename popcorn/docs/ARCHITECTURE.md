# Bone Spatial Studio — architecture and contracts

Bone Spatial Studio turns the manuscript pipeline (`bone_analysis.py`, `bone_figures.py`) into a local web
application: configure samples, parameters and gene signatures in the browser, draw a region of interest on the H&E
image, run the analysis in the background with live progress, and browse the figures, tables and per-bin maps.

Everything below is a contract between components. Names, signatures, file names and JSON shapes must match exactly.

```

Python 3.10+; package versions as stated in `bone_analysis.py` (scanpy 1.11.5, anndata 0.12.9, pandas 2.3.3, numpy
2.3.5, scipy 1.16.3, ...). Code must also run on pandas 3 / anndata 0.13 where that costs nothing (avoid chained
assignment, `inplace=True` on column subsets, relying on object dtype for strings).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Configuration (`pipeline_config.py`, already written — read it)

`default_config()` returns the manuscript setup. `merge_with_defaults(cfg)`, `validate_config(cfg) -> (errors,
warnings)`, `effective_config(cfg)` (merge + raise on errors), `load_config`, `save_config`, `resolve_bin_dir(cfg,
sample, bin_size=None) -> Path|None`, `available_bin_sizes(cfg, sample)`, `bin_um('016um') -> 16.0`, `slugify`,
`sample_by_id`, `sample_ids`, `signature_label`, `compartment_names(cfg) -> (high, other)` (the Figure 4h compartments
in figure text and messages: "growth-plate", "tumor-associated" for the manuscript's osteoclast / chondrocyte split,
else "high-<split_by label>", "low-<split_by label>"; file and column names keep growth_plate / tumor_associated),
`PARAM_SCHEMA`, `STEP_LABELS`, `Progress`.

Key facts used everywhere:
* `cfg["samples"]`: ordered list of `{id, label, condition, color, path, microns_per_pixel}`; N >= 1 sections
  (default two). `cfg["reference_sample"]` is the denominator of every fold change / ratio of ratios.
* Gene sets: `cfg["signatures"][name] = {label, table_label, color, class, canonical, core, extended, competes,
  excluded}`; `cfg["primary"]` (ordered: signatures with a positivity call), `cfg["programs"]` (ordered: signatures
  competing in the tissue assignment), `cfg["classes"]` (drawn tissue classes, ordered; a signature whose class is not
  listed, e.g. "removed", is assigned but not drawn), `cfg["receptor_panel"]` (gene -> role), `cfg["adipocyte_genes"]`,
  `cfg["ubiquitous"]`.
* `cfg["steps"]` booleans decide what runs (see STEP_LABELS); `cfg["figures"]` drives bone_figures.
* Method options added with the fixes (defaults = manuscript): `scoring.depth_matching` ("cap" | "quantile"),
  `proximity.exclude_self` (false), `compartments.tumor_conditions` (["tumor"]) and `compartments.de_sections`
  ("all" | "tumor").
* `Progress(events=True)` prints `@@EVENT {json}` lines (plan, step, step_done, skip, warning, done, error) next to
  human-readable lines; `events=False` prints only the readable lines (CLI).
* Settings that name single signatures are checked against `cfg["signatures"]` (other gene groups, README "Using it
  for other gene groups"), only while the step that uses them is on. Errors (the run is refused), each naming the
  setting, its Parameters field and both ways out (another signature, or the step switched off):
  `compartments.signature` (needs a positivity call) and `compartments.split_by` (steps.compartments),
  `uncoupling.a` / `.b` (positivity calls; steps.uncoupling). Warnings (the output is skipped): `figures.lineage_maps`
  unknown or without a call, `figures.composition_signatures` with no known signature (or unknown names), a positivity
  panel without a called signature, `proximity.pairs` empty (or a pair naming an unknown or, for mode positivity, an
  uncalled signature), no section whose condition is in `compartments.tumor_conditions`, habitat classes of
  `sensitivity_analyses.uncoupling` that no tissue-assignment signature has, `sensitivity.signatures` with no known
  signature while steps.sensitivity is on, `figures.receptor_genes` naming no gene of `receptor_panel` (steps
  receptor_panel and figures on: Figure 6b is skipped), `sensitivity_analyses.lesion.genes` not empty in a configuration
  without the osteoclast and osteoblast signatures (steps.sensitivity_analyses on: Krt7 / Krt18 would flag ordinary
  epithelium as A549 lesion).
* `STEP_HELP` (what each step is for) and `BONE_STUDY_STEPS` (receptor_panel, adipocyte_panel, compartments,
  uncoupling, sensitivity: specific to the bone-lesion study). `PARAM_SCHEMA` ends with a section `{"key": "steps"}`
  that is not a configuration section: one bool field per STEP_LABELS key with its help and `"study": "bone"`; the
  Analysis steps card and the Run tab read it. Signature fields may carry `"uses_step"` (a steps key) and
  `"needs_call": true`; `compartments.tumor_conditions` is a str_list field.

## 2. Python entry points

### bone_analysis.py
```python
planned_steps(cfg: dict) -> list[str]
    # Labels of every step run_analysis_from_config will report via progress.step()/progress.skip(), in order,
    # for this cfg (respecting cfg["steps"]). Must match the labels actually used.
run_analysis_from_config(cfg: dict, out, progress: Progress | None = None) -> anndata.AnnData
    # cfg: any partial or full config; it calls pipeline_config.effective_config(cfg) itself.
    # Writes every output of section 3 into `out` (created if needed). Raises on fatal errors.
run_analysis(root, out, roi_masks=None, mask_frame="hires", do_moran=True, do_sensitivity=False, project_8um=False)
    # Backward-compatible wrapper (old signature): default config with data_root=root.
```
CLI (old flags keep working): `python bone_analysis.py --root . --out results [--config cfg.json] [--skip-moran]
[--geneset-sensitivity] [--project-8um] [--roi-mask SAMPLE=PATH ...] [--mask-frame hires] [--events]`.
An enabled step that has nothing to compute is reported through `progress.skip(label, reason)`, not as done: Osteoclast
compartments without `pos_<signature>` / `score_<split_by>`, Distance to nearest partner without the calls of `a` and
`b`, Proximity tables without pairs, Gene-set sensitivity when `sensitivity.signatures` names no signature (unknown
names are left out with a warning). Each second-review sensitivity module runs only when the step it re-examines ran
(positivity; proximity; uncoupling; compartments; leiden and domain_matrix), otherwise a log line says why; the
uncoupling module also returns nothing, with a warning, when `uncoupling.a` / `.b` have no calls. An empty
`sensitivity_analyses.lesion.genes` flags no bin and gives no warning; when its genes are found, the log says how many
bins are flagged, and a configuration without the osteoclast and osteoblast signatures also gets a warning. The Leiden
step warns when none of `cfg["ubiquitous"]` is in the data (the screen can mark no domain unresolved). The Figure 4h
warnings and the compartment DE table's description use `pc.compartment_names` and the signature's label
("<label> compartments: ..."), unchanged for the manuscript configuration.
Module-level constants (SAMPLES, SIG, PRIMARY, PROGRAMS, RECEPTOR_PANEL, ADIPOCYTE_GENES, UBIQUITOUS, PALETTE,
UM_PER_PX, MIN_GENES, ...) stay importable; they are derived from / consistent with `pipeline_config.DEFAULT_CONFIG`.

### bone_figures.py
```python
planned_steps(cfg: dict) -> list[str]
make_figures(results_dir, cfg: dict | None = None, progress: Progress | None = None, root=None,
             manuscript_extras: bool = False) -> list[dict]
    # cfg None -> results_dir/config.json if present, else defaults. Draws every figure whose inputs exist into
    # results_dir/figures/ (PNG + PDF), each in its own try/except (a failure becomes progress.warn + a manifest
    # entry with "error"; the others still run). Writes figures/manifest.json and returns its "figures" list.
    # manuscript_extras=True also draws Figure 1a and the Figure 2c H&E crops (needs `root`); never in the web app.
```
CLI: `python bone_figures.py --results results [--root .] [--config cfg.json] [--manuscript-extras]`.
`planned_steps(cfg, manuscript_extras=False)` also plans the extras' labels; figure progress labels read
"Draw Figure …" / "Draw Supplementary Figure …".
Skipped, with the setting to change in the reason: Figure 3b when `figures.composition_signatures` names no signature
of the configuration (unknown names are left out), Figure 4a–f when a `figures.lineage_maps` signature is unknown or
has no call, a positivity panel that names no signature, Figure 6b when `figures.receptor_genes` names no gene of
`receptor_panel`. A sensitivity figure whose analysis step was switched off says so; the proximity, uncoupling and
positivity sensitivity figures are skipped when their main table has no rows, the Figure 4h one when
`sensitivity_Figure4h_top_genes.csv` has none (the Figure 4h test was not estimable: no gene to draw). A positivity
panel leaves out a signature that could not be scored (mean_score NaN in every section with bins: fewer than two of its
genes in the data) and names it in the caption; a panel of such signatures only is skipped. Figure 4h and its
sensitivity figure name the compartments with `pc.compartment_names` (growth plate / tumor-associated only for the
manuscript's split).
Figures never read raw Space Ranger data and never need the .h5ad: they read the CSV outputs (the per-bin table has
coordinates and calls) and `config.json`.

### bone_pending_masks.py
```python
load_polygons(path_or_geojson) -> list[tuple[np.ndarray, list[np.ndarray]]]
    # GeoJSON FeatureCollection / Feature / Polygon / MultiPolygon -> [(outer ring Nx2, [hole rings])], (x, y) order
rasterise_drawn_roi(a, masks: dict[str, str | Path | dict], frame: str = "hires",
                    scalefactors: dict[str, dict] | None = None) -> tuple[np.ndarray, list[str]]
    # (bool mask of len a.n_obs, ids of sections without a region). Bin centres a.obsm["spatial"] (full-resolution
    # pixels, columns = pxl_col, pxl_row = x, y) are tested against the polygons of that bin's section after converting
    # polygon coordinates to full resolution: hires: / tissue_hires_scalef, lowres: / tissue_lowres_scalef, fullres:
    # unchanged. scalefactors default: a.uns["spatial"][sample]["scalefactors"]. Inside = inside any outer ring and
    # not inside one of its holes. A section without a region (or with an empty one) is all True; the caller warns.
```

### webapp/worker.py
`python -m webapp.worker <run_dir>` (cwd = project root): reads `<run_dir>/config.json`, makes
`Progress(events=True)`, calls `progress.plan(ba.planned_steps(cfg) + (bf.planned_steps(cfg) if
cfg["steps"]["figures"] else []))`, then `ba.run_analysis_from_config(cfg, <run_dir>/results, progress)`, then
`bf.make_figures(<run_dir>/results, cfg, progress)` if enabled, then `progress.done()`. On any exception:
`progress.error(str(exc), traceback.format_exc())` and exit code 1.

## 3. Outputs (`<out>/`, the run's `results/`)

`{B}` = analysis bin size as in the original names ("16um" for bin_size "016um": `f"{int(bin_um)}um"`);
`{Q}` = qc_bin_size likewise ("8um").

| `qc_threshold_sweep_{B}.csv` | sample, min_genes, n_retained, pct_retained, median_genes (analysis bins, before filtering) |
| `qc_threshold_sweep_{Q}.csv` | same at the QC bin size (Supplementary Figure S1, right panel), plus bin_size |
| `FigureS1_qc_per_bin_{Q}.csv.gz` | sample, bin_size, n_genes_by_counts, total_counts, pct_counts_mt — every bin of the QC bin size before filtering (S1 histograms). A section without square_{qc_bin_size} falls back to the analysis bin size (bin_size says which), with a warning |
| `Figure6b_receptor_panel_depth_matched.csv` | gene, role, sample, roi, mean_raw, pct_detected_raw, mean_dm, pct_detected_dm, n_positive_dm, n_bins, ci_lo_dm, ci_hi_dm, median_umi_per_bin, fold_dm |

| `Figure4g_6a_positivity_native_depth_roi.csv` | signature, sample, roi, n_positive, n_bins, pct_positive, ci_lo, ci_hi, mean_score, fold_vs_reference; plus fold_tumor_over_control (same value on every row of a signature) when there are exactly two samples. Both folds are ratios of the exact rates n_positive / n_bins (fold_vs_reference rounded to 4 decimals, fold_tumor_over_control to 2), not of the rounded pct_positive |
| `Figure4g_6a_positivity_depth_matched.csv` | signature, sample, pct_positive_mean, pct_positive_sd, n_positive_mean, n_bins, mean_score, ci_lo, ci_hi. pct_positive_sd = SD over the downsampling replicates only; ci_lo, ci_hi = Wilson 95% interval (percent) of round(n_positive_mean) of n_bins |
| `leiden_domain_screen.csv` | domain, n_bins, ubiquitous_fraction, median_genes_per_umi, top_markers, de_uninterpretable |

| `Figure4h_osteoclast_compartment_DE.csv` | group, names, scores, pvals, pvals_adj, log2fc_mean_cp10k, pct_group, pct_rest, selection_gene. log2fc_mean_cp10k = log2((mean CP10k in the group + 1) / (mean CP10k in the other compartment + 1)), CP10k = expm1(lognorm); pct_group / pct_rest = % of bins detecting the gene; selection_gene = gene of the split_by signature's scored list (defines the growth-plate compartment, higher there by construction). scanpy's logfoldchanges is not written (1e-9 floor: \|values\| of 19-32 for genes undetected in one compartment) |
| `Figure4h_compartment_summary.csv` | sample ("all" first, then one row per section), threshold (the split_by score threshold used: the compartments.percentile of all bins; also `uns["compartment_threshold"]` of the h5ad), threshold_is_zero, pct_bins_above_threshold, n_growth_plate, n_tumor_associated, n_non_growth_plate_control, n_growth_plate_outside_roi, n_tumor_associated_outside_roi, median_umi_growth_plate, median_umi_tumor_associated |
| `Figure3a_program_composition_native.csv`, `Figure3b_program_composition_depth_matched.csv` | sample, program, n_bins, pct_of_all_bins, pct_of_assigned_bins, sample_ambiguous_pct |
| `leiden_seed_stability_adjusted_rand_index.csv` | seed_a, seed_b, n_clusters_a, n_clusters_b, ARI |
| `FigureS5_domain_by_signature_zscores.csv` | leiden_domain, then one column per primary signature (label) |
| `FigureS5_unresolved_bins.csv` | sample, unresolved_bins, all_bins, percent, unresolved_bins_roi, all_bins_roi, percent_roi; first row sample "all" (all sections pooled, the number quoted before), then one row per section; the _roi columns count bins of the region of interest (in_marrow_roi). Older results have one row and only unresolved_bins, all_bins, percent |
| `Figure4i_observed_to_null_summary.csv` | sample, n_a, n_b, n_units_roi, ratio_obs_null_mean, ratio_obs_null_lo, ratio_obs_null_hi, p_greater_than_null_mean, median_nn_um, mean_nn_um, null_mean_um, status, ratio_of_ratios_vs_reference, note |
| `Figure4i_distance_distributions_observed_and_null.csv` | sample, source ("observed" / "null"), distance_um, count |
| `{from}_to_{to}_proximity.csv` | one per proximity pair (defaults `fibroblast_to_osteoblast_proximity.csv`, `macrophage_to_osteoclast_proximity.csv`, original columns with the signature names substituted) |
| `morans_I_per_section.csv` | sample, gene, I, pval_norm, var_norm, pval_norm_fdr_bh (when available; Benjamini-Hochberg over the genes with a defined pval_norm of that section, NaN for genes with zero variance there), rank_in_sample |
| `FigureS2_spatially_variable_genes_morans_I.csv` | gene, `moranI_<sample id>` per sample, mean_rank |
| `Table1_gene_signatures.csv` | signature, canonical_markers, signature_genes, genes_counted_toward_two_gene_rule, excluded_genes |
| `per_bin_signature_calls_{B}.csv.gz` | barcode, sample_id, section, x_um, y_um, in_region_of_interest, total_umi, assigned_signature, tissue_class, leiden_domain, `positive_<slug>` per primary signature, `positive_<b>_pooled_depthmatched`, `positive_<a>_pooled_depthmatched` (uncoupling pair; suffix `_pooled` for calls "pooled", no columns for "native") |
| `gene_set_sensitivity_three_gene_sets.csv` | optional (steps.sensitivity): gene_set, signature, sample, n_units_roi, n_positive_native, pct_native, ci_lo, ci_hi, pct_depth_matched_mean, pct_depth_matched_sd, genes_used, genes_missing (comma-separated gene lists of the variant; missing genes are also reported as warnings) |
| `joint_{B}.h5ad` | optional (steps.write_h5ad) |
| `labels_{Q}_projected.csv` | optional (steps.project_fine_bins) |

Per-bin conventions: `<slug>` of a signature = its label with spaces as underscores (neutrophil -> granulocyte,
skeletal_muscle -> skeletal_muscle); `assigned_signature` uses the same slug or "ambiguous"; `tissue_class` = the
assigned signature's class ("removed" when that class is not drawn), "unassigned" for ambiguous bins; `x_um`, `y_um`
= full-resolution pixel coordinates (pxl_col, pxl_row) times the section's microns per pixel; `section` = sample label.
A step that is disabled or cannot run leaves its columns out (or empty) and the reason goes to summary.json.

Loupe Browser export (`server.loupe_export(df, cfg, bin_size, out, title, source) -> report`, which GET /export/loupe
calls with the per-bin table, the run's config with an absolute data_root and the bin size of the table's file name):
* Zip entries, sections in config order: `<sid>_<B>_categories.csv` (the run's bin size, e.g. `016um`); when that is a
  whole multiple of 8 µm above 8 and the section has square_008um/filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5, also
  `<sid>_008um_categories.csv` (Space Ranger writes a Visium HD section's .cloupe file, outs/cloupe_008um.cloupe, at 8 µm
  only; other sizes need `--custom-bin-size`); then README.txt (plain text: which file goes with which .cloupe file, rows,
  the parent check, the 8 µm quality control, import steps, the columns, the columns left out, the format choices; the
  Leiden "unassigned" size is the run's clustering.min_domain_bins). `<sid>` keeps letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`.
* CSV: comma-separated, LF line endings, UTF-8 without BOM, no quoting. Header `barcode`, then one column per category
  (its header is the name Loupe shows). One row per barcode of that bin size's filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5, in matrix
  order and exactly as written there (-1 kept): every bin of the .cloupe file. Every cell holds a label: "not analyzed"
  in every column (but "8 um QC") when the run has no calls for the bin (per-bin barcodes are matched to the matrix as
  /gene matches them), "NA" for an analysed bin without a value in that column.
* Columns (loupe_columns), whatever the configuration: tissue_class "Tissue class", assigned_signature "Assigned
  signature", leiden_domain "Leiden domain" (a label of digits becomes "domain N"), in_region_of_interest "Region of
  interest" (inside/outside), then in table order every other yes/no column (positive_* positive/negative, in_*
  inside/outside, else yes/no) and text column of at most 500 values, headed by its name with spaces and a capital
  ("Positive osteoblast pooled depthmatched"; a name taken twice gets " 2"). Left out (listed in README.txt): numbers
  (total_umi, positive_fraction_*, lesion_umi_pooled), sample_id, section, x_um, y_um, empty columns, text columns of
  more than 500 values, and tissue_class, assigned_signature or leiden_domain beyond 32,766 values (Loupe Browser takes
  at most 32,768 per category, "NA" and "not analyzed" included). Labels: "," becomes ";", '"' becomes "'", tabs and
  line breaks become spaces.
* 8 µm rows take the labels of the run bin that holds them. Parent from the grid indices of the barcodes
  (s_008um_RRRRR_CCCCC): index * 8 // bin µm, as bone_analysis.map_domains_from_coarser. Checked against the bin centres
  of both tissue positions files (bins found there by grid key, not by barcode text): the nearest run-bin centre (all
  bins of the file, in tissue or not) must be the parent's. If any 8 µm centre is nearer another run bin, every 8 µm
  bin takes the run bin whose centre is nearest (README.txt says so). An 8 µm bin whose parent is not analysed is
  "not analyzed".
* The labels of an 8 µm bin are its parent's whatever its own counts, so 8 µm bins that would fail quality control on
  their own (even bins without a UMI) are labelled too, unlike the analysis' own projection (step project_fine_bins,
  which keeps the bins that pass). The 8 µm files therefore end with a column "8 um QC" (`matrix_qc`): "pass" or "fail"
  for every 8 µm bin, from its Gene Expression counts and the run's qc thresholds as `passes_qc` decides them (the
  explorer's passes_qc; float32 like bone_analysis), read 1,000,000 stored counts at a time; README.txt gives per file
  how many pass, how many labelled bins fail (and have no UMI) and how many "not analyzed" bins pass. If the counts
  cannot be read the file is written without the column, with a note. Manuscript data: 115,048 of 223,186 labelled
  LL-2-1 bins and 154,257 of 373,080 RL-1-5 bins fail (257 and 477 without a UMI), the same as a recount from the
  matrices.
* The zip is built in a temporary file (deleted after the response or on error), one CSV at a time; rows with the same
  labels share one text. Manuscript result (2 sections, 16 µm): 4.4 s, 7.3 MB zip (CSV 14 and 19 MB at 16 µm, 57 and
  78 MB at 8 µm); the process grows by about 0.45 GB at the peak (working set; measured), mostly while the parent check
  reads the 8 µm tissue positions file (702,000 rows with their barcodes for RL-1-5) and the 16 µm one, and by up to
  about 60 MB for the 8 µm quality control. Repeated exports do not accumulate memory.

Security: binds 127.0.0.1 by default. With `--host` other than loopback a token is required (generated if not given and
printed with the URL); requests carry it as cookie `bss_token` (set by visiting `/?token=...`) or header `X-Token`.

## 6. Job runner (webapp/jobs.py)
* One analysis at a time (memory); FIFO queue; a daemon thread starts the next run when the previous ends.
* Subprocess: `[sys.executable, "-u", "-m", "webapp.worker", run_dir]`, cwd = project root, stdout+stderr merged,
  env adds PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1, MPLBACKEND=Agg, and when deterministic: PYTHONHASHSEED=0, VISIUM_DETERMINISTIC=1 and
  OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS/NUMEXPR/NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=1 (otherwise VISIUM_DETERMINISTIC=0). POSIX: start_new_session=True,
  cancel = killpg(SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 5 s). Windows: CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP, cancel = `taskkill /T /F /PID`.
* Each stdout line: `@@EVENT ` lines update run.json (plan -> steps pending; step -> running + progress; step_done ->
  done + seconds; skip -> skipped + reason; warning -> warnings; error -> error/traceback; done); every other line is
  appended to log.txt.
* Final status: cancelled if cancel was requested; succeeded if exit code 0 and a done event arrived; else failed
  (error = error event message, or the last 20 log lines).
* On server start: runs left "running" become "interrupted"; runs left "queued" are queued again.

## 7. Front end (webapp/static, ES modules, no framework, no network dependencies)
`core.js` (already written — read it) provides: api(), apiUrl(), ApiError, h(), svg(), mount(), clear(), icon(),
button(), menuButton(), popover(), card(), field(), switchToggle(), tabs(), statusBadge(), loading(), emptyState(), errorPanel(),
banner(), toast(), modal(), confirmDialog(), promptDialog(), fmt.{int,num,pct,bytes,duration,date,ago}, debounce(),
sleep(), poll(), copyText(), clone(), state.health, refreshHealth(), route(), navigate(), setPathSilently(),
currentPath().
`menuButton({items, label, icon, kind, small, title, align, cls}) -> button`: a button (aria-haspopup="menu") that
opens a role="menu" popover (.menu-pop) of items {label, icon, hint, onClick, href, download, target, danger, disabled,
title} | 'separator' | {heading}; `items` may be a function, called at each opening. onClick may be async (a rejection
becomes a toast); an item with href is a link (download: true or a file name saves the file). Without a label it is
the ghost icon-only "More actions" button (aria-label = title), with one a button with a caret. One menu is open at a
time; it follows its button while the page scrolls and closes on a choice, Escape, Tab, a click elsewhere, a resize or
navigation, giving the focus back to its button; ↑/↓ on the button open it, ↑/↓/Home/End move in it; modal() leaves
the keys to a menu open in a dialog.
`popover(trigger, content, {label, align, focus, onClose, cls}) -> {el, place(), close({focus}), isOpen()}`: a small
panel that is not modal (role="dialog", .menu-pop.popover) under its button, for a short form. It shares the menus' slot (one menu or popover open at a time) and their placing (kept inside the
window when it fits on neither side of its button) and closing, closes on Escape (focus back on its button; a field
that uses Escape first, closing its own list, keeps it open), on Tab past its last field (focus on the page's next
stop after its button) or Shift+Tab before its first (focus on its button), and when the focus leaves it otherwise
(a click in another field); it focuses its first field on opening. The caller
sets aria-haspopup="dialog" on the button and toggles it with isOpen()/close().
Convention for secondary and destructive actions (move, remove, duplicate, delete, reset): a menuButton, or
`.row-actions`, a span in a table row or list item shown only while the row (tr, li, .has-row-actions) is hovered or
holds the focus (always on touch screens, and while its menu is open; `.keep` keeps it shown, e.g. while a toggle in
it is on). A row or card that opens something on click keeps a real link or button for the keyboard.
`css/app.css` (already written — read it) defines the design system: .page, .page-header, .card, .btn (primary,
danger, ghost, ghost.danger, small, icon-only, toggle[aria-pressed]), .menu-pop/.menu-item (menuButton), .menu-pop.popover (popover), .row-actions,
.input/.select/.textarea, .field, .form-grid, .switch, .tabs, .badge(-status), .chip(.ok/.warn/.bad/.core),
.table-wrap/.table, .kv, .metric, .progress, .log, .banner, .modal, .toast, .empty, .grid-2/.grid-3/.grid-auto, .row,
.stack, .legend, .prose. Use them; put view-specific rules in css/project.css
(projects, project editor, ROI editor, data explorer) or css/run.css (runs, results, viewers). The interface has one dark theme; its
colors come from the CSS variables on `:root` only — never hard-code colors except data colors (signature/sample
palettes).

Routes (main.js, already written) and the view modules they call — each export renders into `container` and may
return a cleanup function (stop timers, remove listeners):
```
#/projects                 views/projects.js  export async function renderProjects(container, {})
                           one card per project: a click on it opens the project's Data tab (its name is the link);
                           Duplicate and Delete project are in its "Project actions" menu (.row-actions). Header: Try
                           the demo (ghost) and New project, hidden while there is no project (the intro has them)
#/projects/:id/:tab?       views/project.js   export async function renderProject(container, {id, tab})
                           tabs: data | explore | parameters | signatures | roi | run
                           explore = dataExplorer() on the draft config (section "Data explorer" below)
                           header: the configuration-check chip only (see "Signatures and Parameters tabs"); Save
                           and Discard are in the bar at the bottom shown while there are unsaved changes (and
                           Ctrl+S). data: the sample table (a row's "Sample actions" menu: Move up, Move down, Remove
                           sample) and the Data check card ("Check again"). run: the project's runs (a click on a
                           row opens the run) and a "See all runs" link to #/runs
#/runs                     views/runs.js      export async function renderRuns(container, {})
                           no Refresh button: polls GET /api/runs every 4 s while a run is queued or running (not
                           while the page is hidden), refreshes when the window or tab is back and on the shell's
                           health events. A click on a row opens the run; the last column has Cancel (queued or
                           running) and the row's "Run actions" menu (Open project, Delete run), which a poll leaves
                           open
#/runs/:id/:tab?           views/run.js       export async function renderRun(container, {id, tab})
                           tabs: progress | summary | figures | tables | viewer | config  (tab null -> progress
                           while queued/running, summary when finished); viewer = spatialViewer(runSource(id)).
                           Header actions, built once (the menus read the run when they open): Cancel (only while
                           queued or running), Export (menu: All results, Figures, Tables = GET /export/results;
                           Loupe Browser = GET /export/loupe), Re-run, "Run actions" menu (Open project, Delete run;
                           Delete disabled while active). An export item is disabled while the run is active, while
                           that zip is being prepared, or when the manifest already fetched has nothing of its kind;
                           the zip is fetched (not linked) and saved, and a refusal shows the server's detail in a
                           toast. figures = figureGallery: a card has no buttons, a click opens the viewer (fit or
                           1:1, previous / next, Download PNG / PDF); "Download all" in the gallery's top line = the
                           figures zip. tables = tableBrowser; each data object and other file is one download link
                           (.h5ad objects are in no zip). config: Copy and Download are icon-only buttons beside
                           "Create project from this configuration"
#/help/:topic?             views/help.js      export async function renderHelp(container, {topic})
                           topics: guide (default) | changes | architecture | readme
```
Components live in js/components/ and are imported by the views.

### Signatures and Parameters tabs (components/signature-editor.js, components/param-form.js)
* `deleteSignature(cfg, name)` removes the signature from every list (competitors, primary, programs, roi.exclude,
  sensitivity sets, positivity panels, composition bars) and drops the proximity pairs that use it; single-signature
  settings stay. The delete dialog lists `signatureUsage(cfg, name)` -> `[{where, step}]` (the Parameters field that
  still selects it; step = the steps key that needs it, null for the Figure 4a–f maps), says that the analysis cannot
  start until another signature is chosen there or the step is switched off, and `deletionEffects(cfg, name)`: lists
  it empties (composition bars, a positivity panel, roi.exclude, sensitivity.signatures with the step on) and pairs it
  drops.
* A signature field shows, under it, why its value cannot be used (unknown, or without a positivity call when
  `needs_call`), with the same ways out, unless its `uses_step` is off; it is checked again when a step is switched.
  Empty composition and panel lists say that the figure is not drawn; the Tumor conditions chips are marked when no
  section has that condition. The Analysis steps card shows each step's help and a "bone study" badge from the
  schema's "steps" section (the Run tab shows the help as the step's tooltip, and the badge).
* Signatures tab buttons: Delete signature is in the "Signature actions" menu at the head of the signature, "Reset gene
  sets to manuscript defaults" in the "Gene set actions" menu of the Signatures card, beside Add (and in the empty
  state, beside Add signature); both ask for confirmation. The move and remove buttons of the calling-order lists and
  the tissue classes, and the remove buttons of excluded genes, receptor-panel rows, proximity pairs and positivity
  panels, are .row-actions.
* Parameters navigation: the section links on the left (hidden below 960 px) are grouped and the cards follow their
  order: Analysis (qc, clustering, scoring, roi), Figures (compartments, uncoupling, proximity, moran, the proximity
  pairs, figures, steps), Sensitivity analyses (key sensitivity_analyses[.*], or a title starting "Sensitivity
  analyses:"; linked without that prefix), Other (Reproducibility and any section added to the schema later). The
  link of the first card in the band from 16 px to a third of the window's height is current (aria-current=
  "location"); a click scrolls to the card, focuses its first visible control and keeps that link current until the
  next scroll, click or key.
* The configuration-check chip, the one control in the header of the project page, shows the check of the unsaved
  settings while there are any: POST /validate with "data": false, 300 ms after the last change (aborted when another
  follows), kept with the JSON of the config it checked; until it answers, and when it fails, it shows the saved
  settings' check and says so. The Run tab and starting a run use the saved settings' check, since runs use those.
  The chip ("Settings valid", or the counts of errors and warnings; a spinner while a data check runs) opens and
  closes the check panel below the header: the errors and warnings, and "Check the data again" (POST /validate with
  the data; aria-disabled while a check runs) with one line on the last data check.

### Spatial viewer (components/spatial-viewer.js, styles in css/run.css)
```
spatialViewer({source, store, binUm, emptyText}) -> {el, destroy(), show({panel?, sample?, field?, genes?, overlays?})}
runSource(runId) -> source        the Viewer tab of a run (GET /bins/samples, /bins, /genes, /bins/image; POST /gene)
geneInput({id, label, placeholder, submitLabel, search, onSubmit, onCancel, suggestOnFocus}) -> {el, input, set, focus, destroy}
                                  onSubmit(names, text typed); commas, spaces or + separate the names
fieldLabel(key) -> display name of a per-bin field
```
* source = {name?, emptyText?, samples(signal) -> [{id, label, n}], bins(sampleId, signal) -> bin payload (the shape
  of GET /api/runs/{rid}/bins, optional "barcodes"), genes?: {search(sampleId, query, signal) -> [{gene, total_umi,
  n_bins_detected, pct_bins_detected}], values(sampleId, genes, signal) -> sparse gene vector}, image?(sampleId,
  signal, {retry}) -> {url, px_per_um, width, height} | null (retry: asked again by the Retry of an image that failed
  to load)}. Every method gets an AbortSignal; a 404 from samples() shows the empty state. The run viewer uses
  runSource; the data explorer a source over the /explore endpoints.
* 1 panel up to one per section, at most 6 (MAX_PANELS): the "Panels" buttons are made once the sections are known,
  1 to min(sections, 6), so with two sections there is no 3 or 4, and with one section no choice at all (a layout
  kept from before is cut to the sections there are); 2 and 3 panels side by side, 4 in 2 x 2, 5 and 6 in 3 x 2
  (panelCols/panelRows; data-cols, data-rows and --sv-cols on the viewer; one column below 760 px), each with its own section (a new panel shows the first section
  no panel before it shows) and two parts: the base map and layers on top. There is no "Color by": the base map is
  gray (every bin in the neutral color, under layers; its one legend entry "Every bin (gray)" hides them like any
  legend entry, which leaves the layers alone, e.g. only the bins passing QC over the H&E image; the legend's "x of y
  bins shown" counts the bins of the coloring and of the layers), or colored by the genes of "Color by genes": a list
  of lines, one gene each (geneInput per line; genes joined by + on a line are summed, 'Ctsk, Acp5' typed on a line
  becomes two lines; "+ Add layer" adds an empty line under the last and focuses it, x removes one, an emptied line goes; at most 11
  lines and calls together). One line: the summed counts of its genes, 0 in the neutral color, detected bins on
  viridis with a log(1 + x) scale clamped at the 99th percentile of the nonzero counts; the color scale starts at
  viridis' quarter point, so the lowest step is brighter than the neutral color on the dark background (no line: gray
  again). Two or more lines: every gene in its own color over the gray bins (gene layers, below), the swatch before
  each line in its color. The panel's state keeps the lines as before (geneLines/storeLines): one line is field
  '__gene__' with st.genes, two or more are 'gene:' overlays and field '__none__', so saved views, viewer.show() and
  the data explorer's gene table (its + adds a line or removes one) keep working; normalizeField() brings any state to
  that form. Or, with the "Top gene"
  toggle (field '__top__', source.genes.top), every bin in the color of its top gene (POST /explore/{sid}/top-genes,
  GET /runs/{rid}/top-genes): the 18 genes topping the most bins in the category palette, the other top genes in one
  gray ("Other genes (n)"), bins without UMIs in the neutral color; the legend says how the top gene is found and how
  many bins had a tie, and the tooltip names the bin's top gene (the gene lines are kept as gene overlays and not
  drawn meanwhile, drawnOverlays(); Show on a line, or a gene added from the data explorer, leaves it). Or by the
  cell types of "Color by cells" (beside "Color by genes"; shown only when the section's bins have the category field
  assigned_signature, i.e. a run's per-bin table, not the explorer's raw data): field assigned_signature
  (CELL_FIELD), with the panel's st.cells, one cell type per line (geneInput over a local list, searchCells: "All
  cell types" first, then the section's types by their bins, "n bins"; "+ Add cell type" adds a line; a name that is
  not a type of the section is refused with a warning). buildCellStyle draws the picked types in their configured
  signature colors (payload "colors"; categoryColors), else palette colors, and every other bin in the neutral color
  ("Other cell types"); ALL_CELLS ('*', the line "All cell types", alone on its lines) draws every type as the
  category field (buildStyle; ambiguous/unassigned in gray). With two or more types picked, their overlap (cellOverlap:
  the bins called positive, positive_<type> at native depth, for two or more of the picked types) leaves the colors
  of single types. overlapCombos (shared with the gene lines) groups the overlap bins by their exact combination
  (a bitmask of the picked types: 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 2 + 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 apart), each with one color of its own (combo:
  true, color = edge: its bins, its cluster outline and its legend swatch; never dimmed), its own shape (shapeOf: the
  combinations of the n picked ordered pairs first, then by mask, take SHAPES in turn: circle, triangle, diamond,
  star, cross, hexagon, triangle-down; with three picked 1 + 2 circle, 1 + 3 triangle, 2 + 3 diamond, 1 + 2 + 3 star;
  once half a bin is SHAPE_MIN_PX = 4 css px or more, drawBins fills the bin in a dark shade of the color and
  drawShapes draws the shape in the color with a thin dark edge; smaller, a square in the color; legend swatches are
  the shape, shapeSwatch on a canvas, and the exported legend draws it too). The colors are calculated to contrast
  (farColors): candidates of 30 hues at several saturations and lightnesses, kept when their CIELAB lightness is 55
  to 92 (they show on the dark map, none looks white), picked one after the other by greedy farthest point: each is
  the candidate whose smallest ΔE*ab (CIELAB distance, as the eye sees color) to the fixed colors and to the colors
  picked before is the largest. For the gene lines, overlayLayers picks the genes' colors and their combinations'
  (geneEdges) together, fixed: background, gray bins, text, the configured colors of the other layers and the
  coloring under them; for the cell types, cellOverlap picks the combinations' colors with the picked types'
  configured colors fixed (mapPalette: the theme, else DARK_MAP). With three genes the closest two colors are ΔE 65
  apart (the earlier fixed palettes: 43). Each combination also has its own cluster count; buildCellStyle puts those
  bins, whatever their assigned type, in one group per combination drawn last, each a legend entry "a + b (n
  clusters)" (key 'combo:<mask>'; hidden, it takes its outline away too), so the counts of the types and "Other cell
  types" leave them out. overlapOutline joins the squares of a combination (one bin pitch wide, neighbors found on the
  bin grid: centre / pitch, rounded) and keeps the sides no other bin of it shares, so bins side by side make one
  shape with one outline; drawOutline strokes it in the combination's color over a dark halo, on the map and in the
  exported PNG; outlinesDrawn() lists the outlines of the cell and gene combinations shown. countClusters counts the
  shapes (bins joined side by side). The legend's "Overlap" section says what the overlap is and names the picked
  types without a positivity call (not counted; fewer than two with a call: no overlap), and lists the combinations
  with a "Correlated genes…" button each (sources with genes.overlapGenes: runs): openOverlapGenes opens a dialog
  with the thresholds in boxes (suggested r >= 0.1, FDR <= 0.05, 3 bins of the overlap; the panel keeps the last ones
  used, corrThresholds), asks POST /runs/{rid}/overlap-genes with the combination's bins on open and on "Find genes",
  and lists the genes passing by r (r, FDR, share of the overlap and of the other bins detecting it), with Show (the
  map colored by that gene, showGeneLines), "Show top 3 as gene lines" and "Copy list" (tab-separated). Show on a cell line sets the field (the gene lines wait
  as for Top gene); Show on a gene line, or Top gene, leaves it and the cell lines wait in turn, each waiting list
  with a note. A kept view with field assigned_signature and no st.cells shows all types. Its legend entries hide and
  show like any other, and the tooltip names the type "Cell type (assigned signature)". The other labels and numbers
  (tissue class, Leiden domain, UMIs per bin, ...) are not colorings: the tooltip of a bin shows
  them, with every gene detected in the bin and its UMIs, most first (the first 150; source.genes.bin, POST
  /explore/{sid}/bin or GET /runs/{rid}/bin, asked for 90 ms after the pointer stops, the last 300 bins kept per
  section), and a click on the bin opens all its genes in a dialog (filter, Copy list as gene<TAB>umi). A panel asked
  for a yes/no field (a view kept from before, or viewer.show({field})) shows that field as a layer over the gray bins,
  the same picture (its negatives hidden: the gray bins hidden); a label or number asked for gives the gray bins.
  Layers (the panel's "overlays" in the store and the code): genes, each marking the bins detecting it, so that
  several genes show on one map, and boolean fields: calls, region of interest, quality control; each in the
  signature's configured color when free, else a palette color apart from the other layers and, while one is left,
  from the colors of the categories the panel is colored by; a bin in two or more gene layers (and no yes/no layer)
  takes the color of its exact combination of genes (buildOverlays with overlapCombos, as for the cell types: one
  contrasting color, a shape, a legend entry with its bins and clusters, an outline around touching bins); a bin
  in a yes/no layer and another layer is in the theme's text color, in the dark text color of the exported image over
  the H&E image and in that image; the
  legend counts the bins drawn in each color (the hover title also gives the bins in the layer); the coloring under them can be
  dimmed. A legend with counts and click-to-hide entries, and a title (section + what is shown: 'Tissue class + Ctsk,
  Acp5', or the layers alone over no coloring; 'n genes' for more than two gene lines). Gene layers are the lines of
  "Color by genes", added with "+ Add layer" (the panel's last control, under the label "Layers"; it no longer opens
  a popover, and the viewer offers no way to add a boolean layer: one only comes from a view kept from before or
  from viewer.show()). At most 11 per panel (one palette color each; viewer.show() adds no more either, with the
  same warning). Each boolean layer is a chip under the controls (its color, its name, a remove button), with "Dim the coloring under the layers" beside them (the row
  shows while any layer is drawn, gene lines included); a gene line whose genes are not in the data or failed to
  load has its swatch marked, with the reason as its title. A gene layer typed in
  another case takes the data's names once its counts are there ('ctsk' -> 'Ctsk'). Adding, removing or renaming
  layers dispatches a bubbling "sv-change"
  event from the panel (the popover lives outside the viewer's element). "Color scales: Shared" (default on): panels colored by
  the same genes or the same number use one range (the smallest low end, the largest 99th percentile), the legend
  says whose range it shows. Pan and zoom are not linked by default: each panel keeps its own view per section and
  moves on its own; with "Linked" on (toolbar, two or more panels) one view in µm serves all panels, with a crosshair
  at the hovered position in the others. The H&E image
  (source.image) can be drawn under the bins, the bins then see-through by the chosen amount; it is asked for again
  with {retry: true} only by the Retry of an image that failed to load. Save PNG (a ghost button at the end of the
  toolbar) writes one composite image of all panels (title, map, scale bar, legend, with the notes of a shared or
  clamped color scale) on white. Zoom in, zoom out and fit are one compact group of icon-only ghost buttons
  (role="group", "Zoom") in the top-right corner of each map.
* Layout: the maps take the window's height less what must be seen with them (the viewer measures it: its place on
  the page when one row of panels starts in the top half of the first screen, else its toolbar and controls; measured
  again when the window is resized or the page above the viewer grows or shrinks; with two rows of panels the second
  row is measured on its own, and a map is at least 200 px high); with
  two or more panels the maps of a row line up (the panels share the rows of a CSS subgrid), the controls of a panel
  sit on one line, and a wide panel (500 px with two rows of panels, 700 px with one; wideFrom) has its legend in a 180 px column
  beside the map (an entry's count under its label), else under it. The tooltip of a bin (barcode, genes shown, the field colored by and the layers in
  bold, the other fields, the remaining positivity calls on one line) is placed in the window beside the pointer, or
  above or below it, never cut by the panel.
* store (kept by the caller between visits): layout, link, sameScale, view (linked), pointSize, image {on, opacity},
  panels [{sample, field, genes, overlays, dim, hidden, views}], and the caches samples, data (prepared bins per
  section, shared by the panels), geneData (the 40 gene vectors used last), images.
* Bins are drawn into one offscreen layer per panel only when the data, the zoom or the style change; panning copies
  the layers. Requests are shared by key across panels and aborted when no panel needs them any more.

### Data explorer (components/data-explorer.js, styles in css/project.css)
```
exploreState(cfg, key, previous) -> state        kept in the project's draft between visits
dataExplorer({projectId, name, state, getConfig, focus, onOpenData}) -> {el, destroy()}
```
* The Explore tab of a project: the raw sections before any run, read through the explorer endpoints (section 5) with
  the draft config, so unsaved data settings are explored as /validate checks them. project.js keys the state by
  dataKey(cfg) plus the qc thresholds (min_genes, min_counts, max_pct_mt); when that key changes, exploreState() starts
  a new state (nothing read; the viewer choices and the gene filter are kept). The state holds the config snapshot the
  requests send, the explore/samples answer, one entry per section ({status idle | loading | ok | error, summary, notes,
  image}), the spatialViewer store, the highlighted panel and the gene filter. "Read again" (a ghost button in the
  Sections card's header) re-reads everything.
* Sections table: one row per configured section, filled as each one is read (sections one at a time, the ones on the
  map first; a section that cannot be read shows why, a failed read has Retry): bins, genes in the matrix, UMIs,
  median UMIs, genes and % mitochondrial per bin, bins passing QC, microns per pixel; the qc thresholds used, barcodes
  without a position and the server's notes underneath. A click in the row of a readable section shows it in the
  highlighted panel (rowAction(): the section name is the row's button for the keyboard; a click that ends a text
  selection in the row does nothing, and the row's other controls, such as Retry, keep their own clicks).
* Map: spatialViewer on a projectSource (samples = the readable sections, bins = POST /explore/{sid}/bins, genes =
  /genes and /gene, image(sid, signal, {retry}) = the "image" of the section's bins payload, kept with the section;
  only retry (the viewer's Retry of an image that failed to load) posts /bins again, for a new image address). One
  bins request per section serves the table, the viewer and the image; payloads read ahead for the table are kept
  (at most 2) until the viewer takes them. Default: one panel, UMIs per bin, H&E available.
* Highlighted panel: the panel clicked or focused last, outlined when there are two or four. markTarget() keeps the
  outline, the section of the gene table, the active row of the sections table and the gene rows in step with it; it
  runs once the viewer is mounted (on every visit: with sections known from an earlier visit the viewer makes its
  panels at once), when panels are made or removed (a MutationObserver), after a press, key, focus or change in the
  viewer, on its "sv-change" event (gene lines or layers added, removed or renamed; the highlighted panel stays) and after each viewer.show() from the
  explorer (section rows, gene rows, a section opened from the Data tab). Gene table: the section's genes by UMIs
  (POST /genes, case-insensitive filter, 50 / 200 / 500 rows) with UMIs, bins detecting the gene and their share. A
  click in a gene row (rowAction(), as in the sections table; the gene name is the row's button) =
  viewer.show({panel, sample, genes: [gene]}); the row is marked and its name pressed (aria-pressed) while the
  highlighted panel is colored by that gene alone. The + toggle at the end of the row (.btn.toggle, icon-only, in
  .row-actions) adds 'gene:<gene>' to the panel's layers (overlays), on top of its coloring, or removes it: pressed
  (aria-pressed, its icon a check mark) and kept visible (.keep) while the highlighted panel has it; its aria-label "Show <gene> as a
  layer" is the same in both states, its title says what a click does. The rows follow the coloring and the
  overlays of the highlighted panel however they change, updated in place (a focused button keeps the focus). Below
  760 px the count of bins detecting the gene is left out (the share stays, its title gives the count). A "Gene
  table" jump above the map (with four panels, and below 760 px where the panels stack) scrolls to the gene table and
  moves the focus to it.
* Data tab: the bin count of every section the data check found is a button (sampleEditor onExplore; aria-label
  "<bins>: explore section <id>") that opens the Explore tab with that section in the highlighted panel; the Data
  check card's pointer has an "Explore tab" text link (reportPanel onExplore) that opens the tab.
