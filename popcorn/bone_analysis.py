================
Visium HD analysis pipeline: A549 intratibial lesion (right tibia, RL-1-5) against the
contralateral control (left tibia, LL-2-1) of the same NSG mouse, both sections on one capture slide, one CytAssist run,
Visium Mouse Transcriptome Probe Set v2.0 against mm10-2020-A. Every feature is a mouse probe, but probes of conserved
genes also capture the human A549 RNA, so the lesion is visible in the data.
[FIX] This paragraph said "Human A549 transcripts are not captured: every transcript is murine". The probe set is mouse
(all 19,059 features are ENSMUSG genes), but mouse probes for conserved genes cross-capture A549 RNA: Krt7 is detected
in 2,523 RL-1-5 bins against 17 LL-2-1 bins, Krt18 in 552 against 13, and Tmsb10 and Itm2b track the lesion. The
lesion is therefore visible inside the region of interest, and the tumor-bearing section's 'unresolved' Leiden domain
is strongly enriched for it (bone_sensitivity/ marks it by pooled Krt7 + Krt18 UMIs).

Reads the Space Ranger binned outputs and writes every table and number the manuscript reports from the transcriptome,
plus the joint AnnData object the figure script draws from.

[APP] Every dataset-specific value (sections, folders, parameters, gene signatures, which steps run) now comes from a
configuration (pipeline_config.py). Its defaults are the manuscript setup above, so the old command line still runs the
manuscript analysis; the web application (python -m webapp) edits and runs configurations.

PROVENANCE TAGS (every function and every step of run_analysis carries one)

  [SHAMIM]            taken unchanged from Shamim Mollah's original pipeline,
                      00_shamim_original/visium_spatial_processing_full_pipeline.py (2024-12-15); "step N" is the step
                      number in that file
  [SHAMIM, MODIFIED]  originates in that pipeline, but its parameters or implementation were changed by Run Zhang;
                      the original setting and the reason for the change are written next to it
  [RUN]               added by Run Zhang; not in the original pipeline
  [FIX]               defect corrected on 2026-10-28; the note says what was wrong and what it changed (CHANGES.md)
  [APP]               added on 2026-10-28 for the configurable pipeline and the web application

Steps of the original pipeline that are NOT used in the manuscript and are therefore not carried over:
  step 2 violin plot, step 6 PCA variance plot, step 8 UMAP plot, step 9 spatial cluster plot, step 10 marker plot,
  step 12 Enrichr GO/KEGG/Reactome on cluster 2, step 14 image features, step 15 CellPhoneDB export.

    (canonical two-gene markers; the lists of the original study design; the scoring signatures of Table 1), at native
    depth and after depth matching, within the ROI (about 30 runs of scoring and null thresholds; 1-2 minutes).
    Every listed gene of a variant is both scored and counted toward the two-gene rule (core = extended = the list, as
    in the original code). The osteoclast list of the original study design equals the scored (extended) list of Table 1,
    so its rows differ from the table1_signatures rows only in that Mmp9 and Nfatc1 also count toward the two-gene rule.
    [FIX] Variant genes absent from the data are reported (warning; Bglap of the original osteoblast list is not in the
    probe set), and every row names the genes used and missing (columns genes_used, genes_missing).
    [FIX] The depth-matched replicates are scored from their own downsampled matrices (they were scored from the native
    .raw, see score_all), with the downsampling and null sizes of the main analysis (native calls n_perm, depth-matched
    calls n_perm_resampled; all calls used 20 before), so the table1_signatures rows equal Figures 4g/6a. A variant that
    cannot be scored reports zero positives with a warning instead of the main calls, and a section without ROI bins
    gives NaN instead of a division by zero.
